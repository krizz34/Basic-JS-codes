This repository contains various simplest of codes which is a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The sole aim of this repo is to showcase some of the codes with which I'm trying to familiarize myself with JS and how it is implemented alongside HTML. These programs are designed to assist with different calculations and conversions, providing practical solutions.
